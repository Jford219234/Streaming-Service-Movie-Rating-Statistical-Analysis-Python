# Python-Streaming-Service-Ratings
For this project, I analyzed a large data set that had a comprehensie list of every movie on four different streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and Disney+. I Imported this dataset into Python, were I cleaned the data and created new dataframes for each service, deleting any null values.  With this data, I Used statistical methods, ttests and confidence intervals to find the mean movie rating for each service and then determining if they were significantly different from one another. I also created histograms and boxplots in python to show the differences between each streaming service. Finally, I took these insights and created a powerpoint presentation that allowed a nontechnical audience to understand these insights and processes.
